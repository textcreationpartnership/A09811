1. CAP. XVII. Whether the Quire may be found in the body of the Church out of Durandus and Platina.The Letter. Durandus examining the cause why the Priest turneth himselfe about at the Altar, yeeldeth this Reason for the same. In medidio Eccle•i• aperui os me•e and Platina noteth, that Boniface was the fi•st, that in the time of ministra•ion divided the Priest from the people. We may see by these few, that the Quire was then i• the body of the Church. That Boniface the second divided the Quire from the people, how to be understood. How long this was done before the fifth Councell of Constantinople. Of the Priests turning about at the Altar.

1. CAP. XVIII. The consent and testimony of Fathers ought to be reverenced:The Letter. If you should erect such an Altar, that i••(an Altar at the upper end of the Quire, or set the Table Altarwise, or fix it in the Quire, or not remove it into the body of the Church) your discretion will prove the only holocaust. For you subscribed when you came to your place, That the other Oblation, which the Papists were wont to offer upon their Altars, is a blasphemou•••igment, and pernicious imposture, in the; I. Article: and also that we in the Church of England ought to take heed, 〈◊〉 our Communion of a memory be made a Sacrifice In the first Humily of the Sacrament. What office at the Altar might be performed by none but Priests. Of Sacrifices mentioned in the holy Fathers of the purest times. Of S. Iustin, S. Irenaeus, Tertullian, S. Cyprian, S. Chrysostome, S. Ambrose, S. Augustine. The Councell of Carthage, &c.

1. CAP. XIX. The meaning of the 31. Article delivered. What Sacrifices are blasphemous fables and dangerous deceits. The doctrine of our Church herein taught by Bishop Mountague, Bishop Andrewes, Bishop White, and Mr. Casaubon. Homilie of Sacraments.

1. CAP. XX. The necessity of admitting Christian Altars. The standing of the Lords Table Altarw•se, or the having of Alta•s is not forbidden in the 31. Article, under the name of blasphemous figments. Abuses of Altars and Sacrifices condemned, not the things themselves. What is the faith of Protestants, and Papists. In what respect the Masse is not to be allowed. The outrage of the people committed in breaking downe of Altars, punishable by law. The duty of well-minded men concerning Altars.

1. CAP. XXI. Altars crept not into the Church.The letter. VV•ether this name of Altar crept into the Church in a kind of complying in phrase with the people of the Ievves, as I have read in Chemnitius, Gerardus, and other sound Protestants (yet such as suffer Altars still to stand) or that it proceed from the oblations made upon the Communion Table for the use of the Pr•est, and the poore, &c. the name b•ing so many yeares abolished, it is fitter in my judgement that the Altar shold stand Table-wise, than the Table Altar-wise, &c.Altars Consecrated with more ceremony, and regarded with more reverence, than any part of the Church, appeareth out of Bishop Iewell. On the Altar stood the Crosse of CHRIST in the Primitive Church, and in Saint Chrysostomes time, and remained there in Queene Elizabeths Raigne sometime: steps unto the Altar: drawne with Curtaines. Archbishops and Bishops and all sorts of people doe reverence towards the Altar. Barbarous Souldiers kisse them. Penitents prostrate before them. Saint Ambrose willing to be made a Sacrifice for them.

1. CAP. XXII. Complying with the Iewes, doth not argue the creeping in of Altars. The enemies of the Church have long pickt a quarrell at her Altars, and her Priests. The Councell of Aquisgrane defendeth them. At what houre of the day Altars came in. Christian Altars came in at Noahs floud: and have so continued in the Christian Church ever since. Danger to meddle with holy and consecrate things. King Iames of blessed memory, washed his hands of medling with them. The polity of the Christian Church was framed by the patterne of the Iewish Church. Sonne of the Church, an honourable name. The complying of Sabbatarians with the Iewes.

1. The Letter. If the Table should stand along close to the Wall, so as y•u be forced to officia•e at the one end therof, the Country people would suppose them D•esse•s, rather than Table•. Besides that Christ Himselfe inst••u•ed this Sacrament upon a Table, and not upon an Altar, as Archbishop ••ra•mer ob•••ves, &c.CAP. XXIII. The conceit of a Dresser unworthy a Divine. Suting Psychicus in Tertullian. The Patriarch and Bishops in the fifth Councel expresse a different apprehension thereof. Christs first institution of the Sacrament, no rule to us in matters Circumstantiall. An Altar confessed by the Author. Saint Paul did, and the Church may order things otherwise than Christ used. The Eucharist to be received Fasting.

1. CAP. XXIIII. The Table on which our Saviour instituted his Supper. The posture of the partakers. Beza describeth it. A Logick Axiom alledged against Altars.

1. CAP. XXV. Canons of our Church need no private mans confirmation Rationibus cogentibus.The Letter. That you do the reverence appointed by the Canon to that blessed name of IESVS: so it be done humbly, and not affectedly, to procure the devotion, not the derision of the Parishioners, and that you do not maintaine it rationibus non cogentibus, and so spoile a good cause with bad arguments. These things I doe allow and practise. The edicts of Princes, Articles of our Creed, our baptisme, Eucharist will be unsetled, if men may require to have these maintained rationibus cogentibus. Ecclesiasticall and temporall authority receive more prejudice by having the same disputed, than suffering it to be railed against. To what distresse the Vicar is put to maintaine the Canon of bowing at the name of IESVS. The Author ill advised to make a jeere of the first and second Service.
